# Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the new architecture for DendyTanks, focusing on its modular design and advanced patterns.

## Core Components

The project is organized into several core components, each with specific responsibilities:

### Entity System
- **Responsibility**: Manages all game entities and their lifecycle.
- **Details**: Each entity is a unique object in the game world, identified by a unique ID. Entities can have multiple components attached to them.

### Component System
- **Responsibility**: Defines data structures that store specific aspects of an entity's state.
- **Details**: Components are simple data containers without behavior. They represent things like position, velocity, health, etc.

### System Processors
- **Responsibility**: Contains the game logic that processes entities based on their components.
- **Details**: Systems operate on groups of components and perform actions like updating positions, handling collisions, or rendering graphics.

## ECS Pattern Implementation

The Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern is a modern architectural approach used in DendyTanks to achieve high performance and flexibility:

1. **Entity Management**: Each entity has a unique ID and can have multiple components.
2. **Component Storage**: Components are stored separately from entities, allowing for efficient memory management.
3. **System Processing**: Systems operate on groups of components, applying game logic without needing to know about individual entities.

## Configuration System

The configuration system in DendyTanks provides flexibility through:

- **Config Files**: Game settings and parameters can be configured via external files (JSON or INI).
- **Runtime Overrides**: Configurations can be modified at runtime for development and testing purposes.
- **Resource Management**: Efficient loading and management of game resources like textures, sounds, and level data.

## Benefits of New Architecture

The chosen architecture offers several advantages:

1. **Performance**: The ECS pattern allows for highly optimized processing of game logic.
2. **Scalability**: Adding new features or entities is straightforward without modifying existing code.
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
